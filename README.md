# Customer Trends Data Analysis (SQL, Python, Power BI)

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using a combination of Python, SQL, and Power BI. The objective is to extract meaningful business insights from retail customer data and present them through an interactive dashboard.

It demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow starting from raw data processing to visualization.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python (for data cleaning and analysis)
- SQL (for querying and data extraction)
- Power BI (for data visualization)

## Project Files

- `customer_shopping_behavior.csv` – Dataset used for the analysis  
- `Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb` – Data cleaning and analysis using Python  
- `customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql` – SQL queries for analysis  
- `customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file  

## What This Project Covers

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Customer behavior analysis using SQL queries  
- Trend and pattern identification  
- Interactive dashboard creation in Power BI  
- Business insight generation  

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the `Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.  

   This notebook includes:
   - Data import  
   - Data exploration  
   - Data cleaning  
   - Connection to SQL database  

3. Load the cleaned data from the Python notebook into MySQL / PostgreSQL / MS SQL Server.  
4. Create a database in SQL.  
5. Run the Python code to insert the data into the SQL database.  
6. Open `customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql` and run the queries to generate business insights.  
7. Connect the SQL database to Power BI.  
8. Open `customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix`.  
9. Build and explore the interactive dashboard in Power BI.

## Purpose of This Project

It demonstrates practical skills in data analysis and business intelligence using real-world tools.
